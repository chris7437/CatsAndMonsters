        <h2> Monsters and cats have nothing in common. Do they?</h2>
        <p>Imagine a creature that stalks its prey with silent intensity, toying with its fear and on purpose not giving
            a final, lethal blow. A creature that can vanish into thin air, leaving behind only a chilling silence
            before and after going to murder. A creature that seems to derive pleasure from the suffering of others.
            That creature, my friends, is your cat.

            First off, cats are nocturnal creatures, often lurking in the shadows like shadowy figures from a horror
            movie. And their predatory instincts? Well, they're downright monstrous. Just ask any unsuspecting mouse or
            bird. Cats stalk their prey with a silent intensity that would make any villain envious, and they finish
            them off with a cold-blooded efficiency that's downright chilling.

            Then there's their mysterious nature. Cats can vanish into the thinnest of cracks, appearing and
            disappearing at will, like some sort of supernatural beings. And their ability to land on their feet from
            any height? It's practically magic, or perhaps a secret pact they've made with the devil.

            Finally, let's not forget their uncanny ability to sense their victims. Cats seem to know exactly how to
            exploit vulnerabilities, and they're not afraid to exploit them. A sudden, chilling meow in the dead of
            night can
            send even the bravest of souls running for cover if they belong to the right species!

            So, the next time your cat is curled up on the couch, batting at a toy mouse, remember: The cat would derive
            even more pleasure if the mice wasn't a toy but had real emotions;
            the mice noises, screams of pain and horror, are among the cat's most favourite sounds.; If this isn't
            monstrous, then what is? </p>

        <h2 id="Monster">Are cat's actually Monsters?</h2>

        <p>Often lauded as cuddly companions, upon closer inspection, clearly visible is their monstrous nature . To
            small creatures like mice and birds, they are nightmare fuel. With cold, calculating precision,
            they stalk their prey, ruthlessly tearing apart families and without remorse enjoying the terror they
            inflict. For a
            bird, a cat is a feathered executioner, a silent death lurking behind bushes and trees.
            Many animals, including humans, possess some monstrous characteristics, even if not immediately apparent.
            Cats, with their predatory instincts, simply exhibit these traits more overtly.

            While we coddle them and provide them with the finest of accommodations, it's important not to forget that
            cats are not only cute af but also savage hunters. Gentle purrs and playful behaviour shouldn't convince us
            they wouldn't harm anyone. Your pet mouse wouldn't thank u that you thought it was a great idea to let em
            sleep in the same bed!
            Therefore cats are, if handled correctly - a perfect tool which can be used for securing your place from pest infestation while
            warming your heart with their wonderful looks.
